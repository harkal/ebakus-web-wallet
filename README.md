# Ebakus Web Wallet

This is the official web wallet which can be embedded into a dApp page to interact with the Ebakus blockchain.

You can check the [released mainnet wallet](https://wallet.ebakus.com) and check how it looks like inside a dApp at [an existing dApp](https://demo.ebakus.com).

## Important

For embedding the wallet to your own dApp check the [wallet loader project](https://github.com/ebakus/ebakus-web-wallet-loader).
